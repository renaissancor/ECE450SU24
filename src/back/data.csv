(RBLC),"Ruizhen Hu, Yushi She, Ziyun Cui, Jiacheng Zhang, Haotian Peng",Yan Matt,Prof. Chong Han,"Anomaly detection technology is pivotal in smart lock security against malicious lock picking and emergencies. Through practical application of Bosch smart locks, the security system is challenged by lock bolt deformation under extreme scenarios, false alarms in the anti-pry lock detection, and vertical alignment maintenance during lock installation.","Sub-system concepts are sensing the position, acceleration, and lock-picking actions of the smart lock. The interdevice communication between sensors, MCUs, and IoT systems is also considered.","The design uses the Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU) to collect the raw data of linear acceleration and angular velocity. The computer is utilized to develop detection algorithms using raw data through the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.0 protocol. Additionally, we developed a digital twin model through Unity on the computer to provide Bosch with insights for further IoT smart life applications. The model can be connected to IoT systems through TCP/IP protocol.","A digital model on Unity is built to transform the sensing data into 3D animation. It first captures the raw data and applies detection algorithms. Then, the attitude of the door will be displayed on Unity simultaneously.","Validation Process:

For bumping prevention, the door is set to high acceleration to simulate the situation that it is blown closed. For installation assistance, the sensor is set to be perpendicular to the door or within a certain angle. For lock-picking detection, the door is shaking heavily and the handle is struck. If the alarm can be set timely and the door's condition can be monitored instantly, it can meet specifications.

2,Solar-Powered E-Bike Charging Station with Intelligent Energy Router,2023,SUMMER,Major Design Experience(MDE),Prof. Chengbin Ma,"Chang Liu, Yanshu Wang, Sizhe Zhou, Jiaru Liu, GEONDO KIM",Prof. Chengbin Ma,Prof. Chengbin Ma,"As e-bikes gain more and more popularity, it not only brings convenience but also plays an important role in environment protection. However, nowadays, common e-bike charging stations do not take advantage of their large top area to collect solar energy. Besides, their large volume and relying on power grid limit their deployment. Therefore, a solar-powered and power-grid-free e-bike charging station needs to be designed.","For the hardware system, Multi-Active Bridge topology is applied and port power is controlled by phase shift. For the software subsystem, considering model generalizability, fitting capacity, cost, efficiency, and suitability, LSTM model is applied for demand prediction.","The hardware circuit uses Multi-Active Half Bridge with 6 ports to convert power. To control it, a controller is designed to collect data, run digital control algorithm, and output drive signal. Combining PID and decoupling matrix, the real-time control algorithm realizes voltage stability for each port. As for the software development, we adopt the ACNData benchmark for the charging demand prediction. We use MinMaxScaler and a scaling factor f to preprocess the data.","A SIMULINK model is built and run for the real-time control. Considering sampling noise and delay, the algorithm can stabilize port voltage and current at load transient.","Validation Process:
For circuit stability, one port is connected to DC source while one of the others is connected to a electronic load. Switch the load current between 0A and 3A, if the port voltage overshoot and undershoot is within 10V, it passes the test. For maximum power, changing the port connection and disabling port current limitation, set load current to 5A and run for more than 30mins. If no fault occurs and temperature does not exceed 60 degree, it passes. For average demand satisfaction rate, the whole system is deployed in a place with sufficient solar supply and applied with average charging demand. If more than 60% of the total electricity demand is met, it passes the test.

3,Comparative Study on Heat Absorption and Release of LTR Cooling Liquid and OHX Refrigerant in Environmental Heat Pump,2023,SUMMER,VLSl Design,United Automotive Electronic Systems (UAES),"Xiaoyu Chen, Chodchanit Jirapavasuti, Assel Surshanova, Wuyuqing Yang, Yijia Zhao",Prof. Zhaoguang Wang,Prof. Chengbin Ma,"Heat pumps play a crucial role in thermal management for new energy vehicles. In this project, the evaporator part of the system is the focus. Usually, there are two types of evaporators in the market, low-temperature radiator (LTR) and outside heat exchanger (OHX). This project is to compare the performance and price of LTR and OHX in a heat pump system.","The OHX is a device that directly exchanges heat from the refrigerant with the air. The refrigerant flows through the micro-channels and the heat dissipated into air through fins around it. On the contrary, the LTR first transfers the heat from refrigerant to the coolant. Then, it cools down the coolant using micro-channels and fins. So, LTR consists of the radiator cooling the coolant and a heat exchanger.","Our test platform was built using the following components. The compressor is 24V DC 600W with POE-68L as a cooling oil. Heat exchanger (of 1.5 horsepower total heat transfer capacity) with constant temperature water flow as the indoor coil. The threads are used as the connections. OHX and LTR are both microchannel with the same dimensions: 46 cm x 35.5 x 2 cm. The system can have two heat transfer directions. This is achieved through the reverse valve. When reverse valve is turned, different ports are connected, and the flow direction of the refrigerant is reversed.","A SIMULINK model is built and run for the real-time control. Considering sampling noise and delay, the algorithm can stabilize port voltage and current at load transient.","Validation Process:
In total, 4 experiments were conducted. Two modes (heating and cooling) were tested for both OHX and LTR. For cooling experiments, higher temperature on the heat source and lower temperature on the cooling air were required.

Validation Results:

Total heat transfer capacity > 2.2kW
Compressor pressure difference > 1.2MPa
Water flow rate: 9L/min
Cost <= 4000RMB
Data can be monitored on the computer
Conclusion:","The OHX has a higher performance in terms of the time to reach steady state, total heat transferred, and COP. However, it is also more expensive (гд170) than the LTR (гд85). Besides, the heat exchanger used on LTR can also be further developed to accept heat from other heat source in EV.","Sponsor: United Automotive Electronic Systems (UAES), and Prof. Zhaoguang Wang, Prof. Chengbin Ma from UM-SJTU Joint Institute"

HASCO has previously built an optic simulation program based on multi-core CPU, but there are still room for optimization of performance if we can utilize the strong parallel computing power of GPU on ray tracing tasks. Thus the main purpose of the project is to implement a GPU accelerated optic simulation program via ray tracing to replace the previous multi-core CPU based optic simulation written by HASCO.","There are three sub functions in our project. First, we need implement the function to generate a random light source. Then we should calculate the reflection and refraction of light with the triangular grid space. We need to use GPU to accelerate this process to confirm the running speed. Besides, we also need to achieve the render function. Our concepts belongs to these three categories.","The design that we finally choose is using the Nvidia Optix API for the light source generation and following ray calculations, and use QT to visualize the results obtained from the calculation of Optix. We read in the sponsor's model into Nvidia Optix, and generate random light sources and rays shooting at the model by writing CUDA, and record all the reflection data calculated and accelerated by Optix, and finally pass these information to our front-end program written by QT, where users can freely zoom and rotate the model, while also specify the position of the light sources and the number of rays.",An Optix-based program is built to calculate the reflection and the refraction of the rays.

However, many studies only focus on material selection, geometric distribution, size and shape of spokes, but ignore the research in pre-tensioned treatment of spokes which has been already applied to the bicycle wheels.","Based on the customer requirements, we build two sets of non-pneumatic wheels which consist of shear band, spokes and different hubs. Besides the wheels, a test bench is also designed to help apply vertical load to the wheel and test its mechanical behavior.","The shear band of the wheels is made by 3D printing using 95бу TPU and the spokes are made by molding with 60бу silicone gel. The hub, which is rigid compared with other parts, is made by PLA. The interface between the spokes and the other parts are designed to be fixed by sliding through groove. The pre-tensioned wheel is modified from the normal wheel by shorten the diameter of hub. For the test bench, a pole is used to get through the hub and fixed to move in vertical direction by four aluminum beams.","The models of non-pneumatic wheels are built in the Abaqus by the python script. After the Abaqus apply the FEA analysis on the model, the results are sent to MATLAB for the post-processing. The following figure shows the computational deformation of the normal wheel when applied load on the hub.","Validation Process:
For the load experiment, the force from 0N to 400N is applied to the hub to get the stiffness. The actual load is measured by a weight under the wheel.

Different materials are applied, concluding that Q235 is best suited due to its relatively low cost, high strength and easy of welding.","Validation Process:
The validation is divided the CAE validation and the physical one. For the CAE validation, a maximum total deviation of 17 mm is observed, wherein the maximum local deviation is found to be at the center of the bar. The physical validation is done by taking the final prototype to the relevant testing facility where the necessary equipment to carry out the static loading test is available, which will be done with accordance to the load point condition in ANSYS simulation.","In thorough compliance with Chinese regulations, our final prototype meets all necessary geometric criteria.
